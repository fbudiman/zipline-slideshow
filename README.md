This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

This project uses Node.js/npm so make sure that they are installed on your machine. To get this running, navigate into the `zipline-slideshow` directory. Run `npm install` to make sure everything is loaded. Then run `npm start` to run the app. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Notes

The images' height and width ratios have not been altered in any displays in the UI to retain the quality of the images. Due to this, some images are more optimal in landscape or portrait mode depending on its dimensions.

If on a desktop, users should be able to use the left and right keys to navigate between images.

The number of views for each image is recorded, and is accessible to the user by clicking/tapping on the image itself. This can be toggled on/off by simply clicking/tapping on the image. This is done this way to avoid taking extra screen space which should be utilized for the image itself.
